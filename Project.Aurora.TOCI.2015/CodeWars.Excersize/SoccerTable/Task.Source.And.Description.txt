Do you like soccer :)

You have a result table for several teams, and there is also a face-to-face match result. You need to write a method to return the new table after applying the result in the table.

The table is like this:

TeamName Game Win Draw Loss  Point
----------------------------------
Arsenal   3    2   0    1     6
City      5    2   2    1     8
Rome      1    0   1    0     1
The new result is in this String form:

"Arsenal 0:2 Rome"
The new table should be like this:

Arsenal   4    2   0    2     6
City      5    2   2    1     8
Rome      2    1   1    0     4
The winner get 3 points Draw gives both teams 1 points

TableRow is class like this:

public class TableRow
    {
        public string TeamName { get; set; }
        public int Game { get; set; }
        public int Point { get; set; }
        public int Win { get; set; }
        public int Draw { get; set; }
        public int Loss { get; set; }
    }
You don't need to rank them in the return table.
